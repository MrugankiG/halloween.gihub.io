            <h3 >There's Someone Under the Bed</h3>
            <p>“I begin tucking him into bed and he tells me, “Daddy, check for monsters under my bed.” I look underneath for his amusement and see him, another him, under the bed, staring back at me quivering and whispering, <strong><em>“Daddy, there’s somebody on my bed.”</em></strong>"</p>

            <p>"I let my little girl sleep with me at night. I still like to snuggle with her despite the increasingly pungent smell of her <strong>Rotting flesh</strong>."</p>

            <h3>Love Letter</h3>
            <p>"I'm having a hard time finishing this sentence in this love letter. Especially since she keeps moving, the knife isn't sharp enough, and there's not much space left on her face."</p>

            <h3>My Phone</h3>
            <p>"I went out for drinks with a friend last night and I lost my phone. When I called, someone answered, gave a low raspy giggle, and hang up. When I went back home, I found my phone on my night stand, right where I left it."</p>

            <h3>I see everything!</h3>
            <p>"I was with my little brother home alone when we suddenly heard a creepy voice from the other room saying "Panda_Panda come here. I want to talk to you." We didn't know who or what it was and immediately ran upstairs.</p><p> While we were running to our room, we heard someone nearby say "Do you boys think you can run from me? I see everything!" At this point we were terrified, locking the door to our room, grabbing our mini baseball bats and crying. We were certain we were going to be killed or eaten by some monster. Then, it happened, a loud bang came from the closet and the monster sprang out.</p><p> We both screamed, my brother fell, and I threw the bat at... my dad wearing an IT clown mask and laughing hysterically. Turns out he was behind the whole thing. First, he had put all the cordless phones in the house on speaker and said he was leaving to run some errands. Then, he proceeded sneak back into the house, hide in our closet, and scare us."</p>

            <h3>Psychiatrist</h3>
            <p>"I'm a psychiatrist by profession and, over the course of my career, I have dealt with many people who have strange and unusual problems. However, one case in particular disturbed me more than any other."</p>
            <p>"There was a family of three who lived next door to me. They were a married couple in their 60s and they had a son who was about 30 years old. The son was what we call in Japan a hikikomori. Somebody who is introverted, reclusive and isolated. Someone who has withdrawn from social contact"</p>
            <p>"We never saw the son. People who are hikikomori usually lock themselves away in their rooms and avoid others. I didn't hear about his condition directly from his parents. I assumed they didn't want to discuss it. In Japan, people are very concerned about appearances and having a son who is hikikomori is an embarrassment."</p>
            <p>"As the days passed, their son went out less and less. Eventually, he never came out of the house at all. Every night, from his bedroom window, the furious voice of his mother could be heard screaming and shouting at him. Whenever I met the poor woman, she smiled and said hello, but the strain was showing in her face. She became pale and haggard."</p>
            <p>"It had been almost six years since anyone had seen the son. One day, the father knocked on my door and asked me to come to his house. He knew I was a psychiatrist and since we were neighbors, I decided to do what I could to help the family.When we got to the front door, the mother was there waiting for us. She led me upstairs to her son's room.She banged on the door with her fist and shouted, We're coming in!"</p>
            <p>"Then, she burst into the room and shrieked, Are you going to sleep forever? Get up, you lazy good-for-nothing! Before I knew what was happening, she grabbed a golf club and started beating the sleeping figure under the covers. For a moment, I was struck dumb as she reigned down blow after blow. Then, I sprang into action, grabbing the golf club and wrestling her out of the room."</p>
            <p>"I hurried back inside to check on her son's injuries, but when I pulled back the bed covers, I couldn't believe my eyes. Lying beneath the sheets was a mummified corpse."</p>
            <p>"I stood there in absolute astonishment, staring at the pile of bones and leathery old skin."</p>
            <p>"The father approached me, hanging his head in shame."</p>
            <p>"It was my wife that I wanted you to see, he said. This has been going on for years. I can't take it anymore"</p>

            <h3>This new old house</h3>
            <p>"We bought an old house, my boyfriend and I. He's in charge of the "new" construction – converting the kitchen in to the master bedroom for instance, while I'm on wallpaper removal duty.</p><p> The previous owner papered EVERY wall and CEILING! Removing it is brutal, but oddly satisfying.</p><p><em> The best feeling is getting a long peel, similar to your skin when you're peeling from a sunburn.</em></p><p> I don't know about you but I kinda make a game of peeling, on the hunt for the longest piece before it rips.Under a corner section of paper in every room is a person’s name and a date.</p><p> Curiosity got the best of me one night when I Googled one of the names and discovered the person was actually a missing person, the missing date matching the date under the wallpaper! The next day, I made a list of all the names and dates. Sure enough each name was for a missing person with dates to match. We notified the police who naturally sent out the crime scene team.</p><p> I overhead one tech say "yup, it's human." Human? What's human? </p><p> "Ma'am, where is the material you removed from the walls already? This isn't wallpaper you were removing."</p>

            <h3>My Daughter Learned to Count</h3>
            <p>"My daughter woke me around 11:50 last night. My wife and I had picked her up from her friend Sally's birthday party, brought her home, and put her to bed. My wife went into the bedroom to read while I fell asleep watching the Braves game.</p><p>"Daddy," she whispered, tugging my shirt sleeve.</p><p> "Guess how old I'm going to be next month."</p><p>"I don't know, beauty," I said as I slipped on my glasses. "How old?"</p><p>She smiled and held up four fingers.</p><p>It is 7:30 am now. My wife and I have been up with her for almost 8 hours.</p><p> She still refuses to tell us where she got them."</p>
